LoRA Weights File Placeholder

This file should be replaced with your actual LoRA weights file.

Expected file: lora_weights.safetensors

To get the LoRA weights:
1. Download from GitHub Releases: https://github.com/MengnanJiangNan/GenAI_Zhaolin/releases
2. Or contact the repository maintainer for access to the trained weights

File should be placed in: flux_lora_style_tool/models/lora_weights.safetensors

Note: This is a placeholder file. The actual LoRA weights file is not included in the repository due to size constraints.
